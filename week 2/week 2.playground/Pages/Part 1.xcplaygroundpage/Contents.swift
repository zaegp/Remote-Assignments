/* 
 4.
 (1) Instance is a specific object created from a class, structure, or enumeration.
 (2) Initializer is called to create a new instance of a particular type. And an initializer is used to initialize an instance of a class, struct, or enum.

 5. 
 There are some differences between Struct and Class:
 (1) Struct is value type(copy data) and Class is reference type(share data).
 (2) An instance of a structure is a value and Class instance is object.
 And Class have additional capabilities that Struct donâ€™t have:
 (1) Inheritance enables one class to inherit the characteristics of another.
 (2) Reference counting allows more than one reference to a class instance.
 
 6.
 The difference between reference type and value type: data storage.
 Reference type share data and value type copy data.
 
 7. There are some differences between instance method and type method:
 (1) Write static or class keyword indicate type methods type method.
 (2) Type method is called on the type, not on an instance of that type.
 
 8.
 In an instance method, self is exactly equivalent to the instance itself.
 In a type method, self refers to the type itself, rather than an instance of that
 type.
